"""Memory watchdog: finds runners whose process tree uses too much RAM.

The agent's 0.1 s service loop calls MemoryWatchdog.over_limit() with its running
jobs. At most once per second per runner the watchdog sums the proportional
anonymous memory (Pss_Anon + Pss_Shmem, see fleet.common.sysinfo.process_mem_kb)
over the runner's session (sysinfo.session_rss_kb; the runner child is its own
session leader, so grandchildren count) and compares the sum with
fraction * ram_total_mb. Shared copy-on-write pages of forked children are counted
once and file cache is not counted, so a healthy fork pool does not trip it. The agent stops and releases (reason "oom") every job the
watchdog returns. The first check of a runner happens one interval after it was
first seen, so a child that is still starting is never signalled before its
SIGTERM handler is installed.
